      "It is very easy to use,I can now watch my favorite movies\n",
      " \n",
      "Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it.\n",
      "Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.\n",
      "Easy to set up and use.\n",
      "It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.\n",
      "I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.\n",
      "A great product for the price, works well!!\n",
      "The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it’s not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.\n",
      "The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\n",
      "I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.\n",
      "It looked brand nrw!! I have nothing to.complain about!! I will defently be ordering more\n",
      "My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!\n",
      "Love it!  So do the grandkids!!\n",
      "Great product!\n",
      "Very convenient\n",
      "Echo Show - White&nbsp;Great new addition to our Alexa home solution and now I can call back home and video chat directly from my phone. Great way to stay in touch with family.\n",
      "When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.\n",
      "Extremely easy to use! Switched away from directv and use it to stream T.V.\n",
      "Was excited to try this on my new Element TV.  Unfortunately even though my TV is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering.  Thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue.  It didn’t!\n",
      "Love it...so happy to have everything available through this\n",
      "Great!!\n",
      "Sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE this!!!  I have it in my kitchen so I can use it for cooking. The speakers are amazing!!!\n",
      "Great interface.  i enjoy the voice remote\n",
      "Really enjoying my firestick can’t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.\n",
      "We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Love my echo show!\n",
      "We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.\n",
      "I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.\n",
      "This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!\n",
      " \n",
      "The Echo Spot is great!\n",
      "quite nice...clear, great sound.\n",
      "Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.\n",
      "Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.\n",
      "Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.\n",
      "The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.\n",
      "Disconnects often\n",
      "just what I expected,already have 2 other  shows\n",
      "The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.\n",
      "Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices\n",
      "I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.\n",
      "I’m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen. There’s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions. Make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please!\n",
      "I already had purchased the Echo and a couple of Dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped.  I am very glad I did.  The versatility of the video screen is outstanding.  No regrets!\n",
      "Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you.\n",
      "Surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing. I think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices. I have nearly all of them. ;-)\n",
      "Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!\n",
      "Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon\n",
      "Love my echo dot!!!\n",
      "Had a dot and upgraded to this! I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions\n",
      "Very intelligent, love the songs ....\n",
      "very nice and its does not take up space\n",
      "Everything\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Wish volume was capable of going louder\n",
      "Works like a charm.\n",
      "We are really enjoying the echo plus. It is fun too.\n",
      "Absolutely LOVE my Echo Show!  It is awesome and works great with my Ring Video Spotlight Cams!  Music on demand and so many more features that I have yet to explore!!!\n",
      "After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.\n",
      "Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have “themes” in the menu to choose from!\n",
      "Music, weather, time.\n",
      "so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app\n",
      "I wanted to use it as a clock in our bedroom.  But the font is too small to see from any distance.  And apparently you can't change it.\n",
      "Easy to use!\n",
      "Great sound and easy to set up.\n",
      "No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .\n",
      "I love it. It is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does.\n",
      "Listens well, does way more than expected, love her!\n",
      "No problems\n",
      "I liked linking two more rooms in the home\n",
      "Great Purchase\n",
      "item returned for repair ,receivded item back from repair 07/23/18 . parts missing no power cord included.please advise\n",
      "This is pretty cool\n",
      "We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.\n",
      "Great to wake up to music and being told the weather.\n",
      "None\n",
      "the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;\n",
      "The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.\n",
      "Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things.\n",
      "Use as my 3rd dot. Bought so my husband would be able to contact someone if he falls and doesn't have access to phone.\n",
      "Works well. Not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately.\n",
      "Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don’t have a “smart home” and don’t intend to make it one. But it’s fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.\n",
      "Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.\n",
      "It was a gift and the recipient love love loves it 😍💋💋💋💋❤!\n",
      "Pretty cool device. Still have a lot to learn, but I'm changing channels on my Fios, and getting info needed. the speaker is great for what I needed it for, which mainly is music.\n",
      "Was Leary about refurbished but work great.\n",
      "Works beautifully, excellent sound.\n",
      "saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.\n",
      "The current demand for this stick, was too high for the power coming out of my USB port on the TV. Had to run the power cable to the supplied USB adapter. Not a big deal but added another cable showing on my wall mounted TV.\n",
      "Love it even though I’m still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.\n",
      "Great buy at $20!\n",
      "Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.\n",
      "Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!\n",
      "Love how I can take it on vacation and use it. Very easy to set up.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised! It’s awesome so far\n",
      " \n",
      "The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.\n",
      "I like my Amazon Fire stick I use it for my TV thank you for your help when I called you to get further instructions how to use it thank you have a good evening\n",
      "Eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring I don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can’t connect to my Spotify unless it’s premium and I’m in college and I’m not paying or that or amazon music so\n",
      "Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -\n",
      "Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.\n",
      "Works well I have several of these recommend to anyone\n",
      "Very fun to use and having morning briefing\n",
      "Glad I bought this.\n",
      "We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.\n",
      "It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.\n",
      "Still need more AI built into it to interact better. It needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding / answer needs to be right. You can't keep stop Alexa and ask again and again. Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in.\n",
      " \n",
      "Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!\n",
      "Son loves it.\n",
      "Very easy set up. Really enjoying it\n",
      "This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.\n",
      "Awesome, wish I had gotten one sooner.\n",
      "Got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. It sounds pretty good and works well so far.\n",
      "beyond awesome\n",
      "So far I like it 🤓\n",
      "It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.\n",
      "Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands.\n",
      "Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.\n",
      "I really love the hub feature\n",
      "Love my fire stick and remote, so easy to set up and use. Endless amounts of apps to download! Used it with my smart tv and it’s 100X better than the features smart TVs offer\n",
      "very easy to set up and very easy to use\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.\n",
      "Easy to Install. Very clear speaker. I took one star off because it was delivered late by OnTrac-like usual.\n",
      "I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.\n",
      "Alexa is phenomenal!\n",
      "as expected\n",
      "Tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. You still need some work on the AI, in responding to random questions though. My Android phone is far better at those... with the Echo I still get a lot of &#34;hmm, I'm not sure&#34; or &#34;I don't have an opinion on that.&#34;\n",
      "Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español.\n",
      "My Father liked the added programing in which he is interested.\n",
      "I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????\n",
      "I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%\n",
      "Ease of usage\n",
      "I’m really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more.\n",
      "Great device, responsive and helpful\n",
      "Works fine, I wanted this for my bedroom television.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "We are loving Ours very much\n",
      "Totally gets out sense of humour\n",
      "If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??\n",
      "Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday.\n",
      "Great improvement over the original Echo.  Like the ability to see lyrics to songs, watch Prime TV and get other visuals.  The little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination.\n",
      "product stopped working after return time ran out\n",
      "Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\n",
      "Using as a hub and music.\n",

      "I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.\n",

      "Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.\n",

      "Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.\n",
      "Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.\n",
      "Love this product I use it as my bedroom clock perfect size with a lot of other options. The only thing I would like to see them add on to it is the ability to fall asleep to mu as if and set a timer for it to go off on it's own. Like you can with tv t hcfe sleep mode.\n",
      "Unit came with the wrong plug, will have to send back to Amazon.\n",

Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\n",

      "I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!\n",
      "Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice\n",

      " \n",
      "It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.\n",

      "I bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.\n",
      "I'm an original purchaser of the Echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and I've always loved it. I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it's got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!\n",

      "Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.\n",
      "i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.\n",
      "For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.\n",
      "Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.\n",
      "Very satisfied with the product\n",

      "I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.\n",
      "The Echo Show works great. I enjoy  very much.\n",

      "Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.\n",
      "Love it!  Great to request music and be able to see lyrics.  I had a dot, but this is so much better.\n",

      "We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.\n",
      "I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.\n",

      "Works great, some of the apps will start buffering but it’s probably my internet. Love the Alexa voice control.\n",
      "Love the dots, especially with the ability to talk from one to the other, these are really convenient. No issues with the refurbished as they are like new.\n",
      "Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.\n",
      "Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.\n",

      "It works\n",
      "I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.\n",
      "Nice product A+\n",
      "Works great!\n",

      "It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...\n",
      "Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.\n",

      "You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!\n",
      "This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.\n",

      "Love the Firestick! My kids love that they can talk to Alexa and get the weather, local news, etc.\n",
      "I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol\n",

We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!\n",

      "I have the dot and Echo Plus, this one can't seem to &#34;hear&#34; me as well and doesn't do as much as I expected.\n",
      "I used it as an alarm clock  i lov it\n",
      "Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.\n",
      "Just like any other echo. Doesn’t disappoint\n",
      "Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose\n",
      "Loved it!! Wish I would have bought one sooner.\n",
      "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18\n",
      "Love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable!\n",
      "Am very happy now that i can see.\n",
      "Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!\n",
      "Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.\n",
      "I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.\n",
      "I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.\n",
      "We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.\n",
      "I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don't get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana.\n",
      "Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.\n",
      "I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!\n",
      "Easy set up\n",
      "Works well. Need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.\n",
      "The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.\n",
      "Very easy to set up and straight forward directions. Loads fast also.\n",
      "I didn’t realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. I thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you Singley plugged into your tv. However, since using my amazon fire stick I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all.\n",
      "So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!\n",
      "She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great\n",
      "Like it alots, something different than traditional television. The use of Alexa is nice too.\n",
      "Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose\n",
      "I like how small it is, but I’m still able to see my Ring cameras.\n",
      "Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.\n",
      "My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without.\n",
      "Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.\n",
      "Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español.\n",
      "I absolutely love my Show!\n",
      "Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play\n",
      "Easy set up\n",
      "I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself\n",
      "See subject line.  Love it\n",
      " \n",
      "Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could be better. Must be on the same bandwidth as other Alexa devices for whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.\n",
      "Love it!  We have other echoes and love those so I bought this on prime day!  No regrets.  Love that I can connect to my Ring and see the front door.  Yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along. .\n",
      "Good quality, great sound quality\n",
      "Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.\n",
      "Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!\n",
      "Very convenient\n",
      "Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...\n",
      "Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party\n",
      "great\n",
      "Entertainment\n",
      "So far we have enjoyed it.  The only problem we have is I have not been able to call one of my sons with it (the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me:( )\n",
      "Fun to work with still learning everything she can do\n",
      "Fun to use, good sound quality\n",
      "The best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.\n",
      "Ease of use and many tasks it will perform\n",
      "The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.\n",
      "Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What's not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected\n",
      "My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.\n",
      "Wish I bought one for work too\n",
      "I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes.\n",
      "I love love love it.\n",
      "The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.\n",
      "Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house\n",
      "I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!\n",
      "Alexa is perfect for people like me living alone. At least I have someone to talk to.. to keep my sanity. 😂 Though I wish it has a powerful speaker and no need to connect it to bluetooth speakers.\n",
      "The Echo Spot is compact, nice sound and camera quality. Makes it great to video chat with the family when I'm travelling for work. Ease of use that the youngest member (10 years) has no problem talking to Mama on the video chat and understands the important of digital security.\n",
      "it does everything that it offers.\n",
      "Love the TV/movie selection. I really like the fact that I can just rent a movie if they don't have it in their selection.\n",
      "its okay but keeps dropping wifi!\n",
      "Love it!  Great fun!\n",
      "Given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  She loves it.\n",
      "Works great! Alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for!\n",
      "LOVE!! i still haven't figured out all the best things we can do with it.\n",
      "The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping.\n",
      "Works great! I recommend it to anyone who has prime, WiFi and an hdm1 tv. That’s all u need. I’m not really technologically savvy but even I was able to set it up with included and on screen directions.\n",
      "love my spot\n",
      "I am guilty of not setting this up, I had my youngest daughter do it. She did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out. So I would have to assume it was not very difficult. I have not tried to use it  yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself.\n",
      "It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "We now have a dot, spot, echo and show and love the show and spot best. The show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather, recipes and sing alongside. Super deal.\n",
      "This was just an additional one for my other TV. Loved it so much use it on the regular TV. Easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate. I don’t waste my money on regular TV cable or anything else. This is enough for me as I don’t watch too much TV.\n",
      "My son loves his Echo Dot.\n",
      "Easy to hook up.  Wish I knew all its capabilities\n",
      "Home entertainment\n",
      "Awesome product, very responsive!Alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music. It uses the Bing search engine instead of google. If only the two could combine. It would be a perfect product.\n",
      "There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.\n",
      "I liked linking two more rooms in the home\n",
      "Got this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don't need to go see who at my door anymore while I'm gaming.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "I love it it is awesome\n",
      "I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.\n",
      "It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.\n",
      "Use it all the time and love it. Very quality product.\n",
      "I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.\n",
      "During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my \"smart\" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!\n",
      "Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\n",
      "Great size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!\n",
      "Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.\n",
      "It’s better than I thought, it practically turns your regular tv into a smart tv!\n",
      "It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!\n",
      "Just what I expected....\n",
      "Amazing paroduct\n",
      "Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.\n",
      "I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs\n",
      "I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights\n",
      "This echo spot is great I love it\n",
      "We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!\n",
      "Love Alexa, bought others for friends\n",
      "Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.\n",
      "We like it better than Roku.  Voice commands really work.\n",
      "Easy to install\n",
      "Usual reliable Alexa\n",
      "I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...\n",
      "Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.\n",
      "I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "Still learning to use these things.  They sure are smart!  haha  She started reading a book to me yesterday.  Get one.  I like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night.\n",
      "like new, good refurbishing\n",
      "Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.\n",
      "I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!\n",
      "Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.\n",
      "Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\n",
      "This is a gift.  But I have one and love it.  The words to songs are great and the I live the face I chose for the clock.  This is my favorite echo (unless I am listening to music).\n",
      "This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\n",
      "I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%\n",
      "Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.\n",
      "Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.\n",
      "I like almost everything\n",
      "Love our little dot. I don’t know what the original larger Alexa can do that the dot cannot do but we are pleased with our dots capabilities.\n",
      "The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.\n",
      "I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.\n",
      "Very easy to set up. Does what is said it will. Very satisfied so far..\n",
      "I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\n",
      "Works well\n",
      "Love it l. I plan on getting an echo for the kitchen.\n",
      "this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!\n",
      "I love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99.\n",
      "This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.\n",
      "This used “dot” works fine, it compliments my Echo.\n",
      "Its got to be one of the coolest things.\n",
      "Speaker could be better qualty\n",
      "Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.\n",
      "Works as advertised\n",
      "Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!\n",
      " \n",
      "Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Is amazing I have all 3 and I love this\n",
      "Sound quality is disappointing.\n",
      "I like the built in hub. Plus the unit sounds great, just wish it had a volume control on it.\n",
      "Cool\n",
      "Good quality, great sound quality\n",
      "Alexa hardly came on..\n",
      "Purchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Everything\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference.\n",
      "Have not used it yet. But I'm sure it's as great as the others.. I can not get over how amazing the echo , echo dots are. This has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out.\n",
      "I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.\n",
      "Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program\n",
      "great love it\n",
      "Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.\n",
      "Absolutely love it!!!!\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "It good\n",
      "It’s my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes.\n",
      "This is my fourth Echo (original and two dots). It's the best.... Decent speaker... Fun graphics...\n",
      "Very easy setup.\n",
      "The Echo does not link to Direct tv even though they said it would. I have spent multiple hours on this. Made phone calls and texts. Also is missing free bulb.\n",
      "I don't have Alexa, but after getting this I'm feeling inspired to get one. I feel this is a good gateway and or Alexa trial, and liking it so far.  Channels work just fine like Apple TV, just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing, because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching YouTube clips\n",
      "Menu doesn’t work. Says it can’t connect to amazon network\n",
      "Fun taking to the TV. Works good. It’s a little confusing moving around the programs.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!\n",
      "So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.\n",
      "Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.\n",
      "Works as expected!\n",
      "I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos\n",
      "Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine\n",
      "I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.\n",
      "It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.\n",
      "Alarm and music, information the weather\n",
      "I love using my Echo Show for music, it sounds amazing! Unfortunately the video quality when video chatting isnt great, my husband and I video chat often and his video comes out very clear on my end but he says my image is very pixelated. I'm still learning to use it but so far so good.\n",
      "The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.\n",
      "Just as good as the new one I bought but $10.00 less.\n",
      "Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.\n",
      "Love my spot, it now acts as my new alarm.\n",
      "Easy to set up.\n",
      "Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then.\n",
      "Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.\n",
      "I've had an Alexa Dot for some time but I'm really enjoying the Alexa Show. It's great to have a visual whether it's a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I'm not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one's watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven't had it long enough to try everything.\n",
      "Unit is working great, but it is a true PIA that products today are shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.\n",
      "I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.\n",
      "I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good.\n",
      "Love my echo show! Great sound and picture. Does a great job thing in my entire echo collection!\n",
      "Great to have along with the Echo\n",
      "Fairly easy to use\n",
      "We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\n",
      "As you can see Echo Show is in kitchen. It far exceeds my expectation. There’s a wealth of information about any topic. If is customizable for sound and video. I also have Echo and Echo Dot. You can group them and have hole house music. Still not done exploring all it can do love it. Perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you’re preparing to cook.\n",
      "Up dated news\n",
      "Love this\n",
      "Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps\n",
      "This firestick is everything!\n",
      " \n",
      "Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!\n",
      "Love it. It is in my kitchen so I can watch Prime Video while cooking.\n",
      "I cant figure out how to use it.\n",
      "Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.\n",
      "Enjoying it so much!!!\n",
      "Was a gift\n",
      "I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.\n",
      "Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.\n",
      "Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished.\n",
      " \n",
      "Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?\n",
      "Love Alexa, bought others for friends\n",
      "This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..\n",
      "As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.\n",
      "For the size of the screen this thing should be $25\n",
      "Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.\n",
      "I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\n",
      "Love this thing. People think I’m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. But I don’t care!! For me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! So glad I don’t have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say “Alexa, turn off the lights” (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom.\n",
      "Love my spot. Have that , a dot, and a regular echo\n",
      "Works. Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.\n",
      "Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!\n",
      "The speaker could be better...\n",
      "Better than expected!\n",
      "Super easy set up! Great features! FUN!\n",
      "I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you\n",
      "Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!\n",
      "Amazing product\n",
      "Easy to setup.  Sometimes Alexis does not work the greatest. The connection fire stick and WiFi is way bettter than Netflix .\n",
      "I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.\n",
      "Love my Echo great sound very smart!\n",
      "Works really well.\n",
      "Love the ease of use and convenience the echo spot has offered\n",
      "A great device\n",
      "Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don't have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, \"I don't know that skill\" even though I've added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut.\n",
      "Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!\n",
      "I love it!!\n",
      "Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover.\n",
      "Blue light blinks all the time\n",
      "Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.\n",
      "Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!\n",
      "Excellent why didn’t I think it is in the beginning I love it\n",
      " \n",
      "So far so good\n",
      "Purchased to use on the road in my semi. Does not work in that application.\n",
      "Es  excelente funciona genial\n",
      "I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...\n",
      "The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.\n",
      "Excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house.\n",
      "I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees\n",
      "This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.\n",
      "I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected\n",
      "It does everything  the big guy does\n",
      "Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.\n",
      "I love the firestick ! It's easy to set up and use. It rarely stops to buffer and. It  would be a bargain at twice the price.\n",
      "It's Alexa.... what else can you say\n",
      "The volume is very low\n",
      "Easy setup, easy use, work with other smart products, always learning what it can do\n",
      "I used Chromecast before this, it was okay. But I love the FireStick. Works great, doesn’t lag. Would recommend!\n",
      "Looks and performs as new.  No complaints!\n",
      " \n",
      "Love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.\n",
      "Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.\n",
      "Easy set up, nice looking interface and I like the new slightly larger remote. I have a 1st Gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time. And great price!\n",
      "Still haven’t learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!\n",
      "I love it!!!\n",
      "Love it! Easy setup and I can ‘Drop in’ on my daughter and son-in-law who live in St. Louis anytime. Everyone loves to have their mother drop in, right 😎\n",
      "Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.\n",
      "Just like the other one\n",
      "Fun tech toy\n",
      "Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.\n",
      "Love the fire stick. Alexa works well on it too. Would recommend.\n",
      "Ease of use.\n",
      "Love it. It's like having a second wife.\n",
      "It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Absolutely love it\n",
      "Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home\n",
      "Love my Echo Spot!\n",
      "Best streaming device I've used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the Roku remote does.\n",
      "I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.\n",
      "Perfect for a home office\n",
      "Second dot.\n",
      "Highly like my eco show.no complaints\n",
      "Granddaughter loves it\n",
      "I put it on a TV that didn’t have a great picture and it now looks like a new TV\n",
      "I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry.\n",
      "Very easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup\n",
      "Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don’t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it\n",
      "I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.\n",
      "At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.\n",
      "Clear screen and great picture\n",
      "This was a Prime Day purchase. I'm still learning my way around it. So far, so good. The addition of Alexa is nice.\n",
      "Very easy set up. Really enjoying it\n",
      "The ease in installing\n",
      "Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password\n",
      "Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!\n",
      "Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot.\n",
      "The Echo Plus is great! So easy to set up and with the built in hub, it connects to other Alexa devices with a mere verbal command. I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!\n",
      "Works and sounds great.\n",
      "Excellent product, set up with ease as well.\n",
      "Like it. Still working discovery. Really too soon to fully evaluate. But looking forward to learning and using it.\n",
      "We all love her!\n",
      "Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!\n",
      "Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube.\n",
      "What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!\n",
      "Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.\n",
      " \n",
      "Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.\n",
      "It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things\n",
      "Love the alarm feature...just tell what time.\n",
      "Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!\n",
      "I love my fire stick. It is so easy to use.\n",
      "I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I'm now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't.\n",
      "How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.).\n",
      "It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!\n",
      "I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!\n",
      "Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.\n",
      "Barry\n",
      "The volume is very low\n",

      "As Always, easy to set up\n",
      "Used twice not working!!!!!!!\n",
      "We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.\n",
      "I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.\n",
      "Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.\n",
      "Great sound and easy to set up. Purchased the Echo Plus because it had a built in Hub and would make it easier to connect to devices. I am hooked on Alexa!\n",
      "Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.\n",
      "Family loved it!\n",
      "Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to\n",

      "I have a friend now.\n",
      "I really like it .\n",
      "I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.\n",

      "Good sound works well\n",
      "I agree ...YouTube should be on there.\n",
      "Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.\n",
      "Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.\n",
      "My favorite Echo. A more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.\n",
      "Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information​ center and so much more.\n",

      "Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.\n",
      "Love these guys they work so great\n",
      "absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use\n",
      "For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.\n",
      "Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.\n",
      "excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns\n",
      "It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.\n",
      "Fun to use, good sound quality\n",
      "Love, Love, Love!!\n",
      "Absolutely love it. After much persuasion from a friend, I finally gave in and bought one. Let's just say that the moment Alexa enters my life, I turn around and tell Siri to get the hell out.\n",
      "Love it. So great to use!!!\n",
      "it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works.\n",

      "We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.\n",
      "Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable—expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.\n",
      "Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good\n",
      "I'm addicted to this thing.\n",

      "Like new\n",
      "I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.\n",
      "Great, love it!\n",
      "Great price.  I love my echo dot,\n",
      "Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.\n",
      "The way the music sounds is poor quality\n",
      "Works perfectly\n",
      "We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.\n",

      "Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.\n",
      "Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It’s far from being useful.Half the time when you “wake” the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn’t hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It’s been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I’m past the return period...... zzzz\n",
      "We have 3 echos now, even one in the barn, great idea for when I am working with my horse, can still get news flashes & my music!\n",
      "Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.\n",
      "Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "We like the video calling feature. We got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its “name” from all over the room.\n",
      "Works great, never had any issues.\n",
      "Arrived right on time and works as expected\n",
      "I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.\n",
      "Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it.\n",
      "Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it’s is great to be able to see him in between visits.\n",
      "Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc.\n",
      "I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa\n",
      "Bedroom clock , ask questions,  weather reportsAlarm clock ⏰. Music 🎶 download music\n",
      "Item as described and delivered on time.  Thank you\n",
      "Fun To interact with\n",
      "Love it!!\n",
      "Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t respond or you forget the correct command.  “Alexa, turn on the living room lights”.  Oops I mean “Alexa turn on the family room lights”. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit.\n",
      "Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.\n",
      "Great product and Prime Day price! Took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other Echo devices in my home. This came with a Philips smart bulb. It's better than having a clapper! I found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. Very easy to set it up with the instructions. You even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!\n",
      "So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or \"skills\", but getting the hang of it.\n",
      "I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.\n",
      "I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven't figured it all out yet, but so far it's pretty cool!\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.\n",
      "I love you, Alexa!\n",
      "PHENOMENAL\n",
      "This product is even better than I imagined. I love the timer setting, it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to, and i love shopping list feature.  My family enjoys the games too! It’s made my life a little more easy! Alexa is my personal assistant. :)\n",
      " \n",
      "The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.\n",
      "I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.\n",
      "Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.\n",
      "Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.\n",
      "Purchased this for the Man cave and loving it.\n",
      "The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.\n",
      "wonderful product and fast delivery!\n",
      "Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music.\n",
      "looks great\n",
      " \n",
      "awesome product! I am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and The Show is now my favorite device!\n",
      "I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier\n",
      "Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!\n",
      "Exceeded my expectations\n",
      "Love it. The only downside is that you can't download any app you want.\n",
      "Great deal, great product!\n",
      "Easy setup very fun to use. Connects with all my smart home appliances\n",
      "No problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.\n",
      "Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\n",
      "Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.\n",
      "Already had a firestick in our livingroom, great entertainment, had to get one for the bedroom.\n",
      "Liked 100%\n",
      "Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo.\n",
      "Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!\n",
      "I am impressed with the sound quality.\n",
      "I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.\n",
      "I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.\n",
      "Good device\n",
      "Does not work all the time\n",
      "This is my second Show.  I like them very much.  I use mine for music and my Arlo security cameras.  I can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice. They are exceptionally capable devices.  I highly recommend them.\n",
      "Satisfied with the purchase\n",
      "Love the echo show, can keep I can video chat with the kids and grandkids. I have it in the kitchen, so when I run out of something I have Alexa to add it to my grocery list. I use it for everything. Was very easy to set up\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.\n",
      "I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!\n",
      "I try use with yale lock but isn’t work\n",
      "I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.\n",
      "Love how it shows the song info on the screen if playing... also time, notifications, news, etc!\n",
      "It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.\n",
      "Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!\n",
      "Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!\n",
      "It was easy to use for our bedroom TV.\n",
      "Works great and has been fun to use.\n",
      "love it as I do all of my echos\n",
      "Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded\n",
      "Listen music and set timer\n",
      "Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.\n",
      "I already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it.  Bought these new ones during the Prime sale.\n",
      "Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.\n",
      "I have it in the kitchen. Great for news or music in the a.m. I can video call my daughter and grand kids. I really dig it!\n",
      "Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?\n",
      "I like it as an Alexa device but its small.\n",
      "The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.\n",
      "Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things.\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "Cord cutting\n",
      "Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great\n",
      "Such a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.\n",
      "I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.\n",
      "This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!\n",
      "We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\n",
      "Love our Fire Stick,easy to set up and have loads of shows for free and plenty to rent or buy.We also use Pluto TV and Tubi so that's even more TV.Alexa makes it so easy to find any show or movie I want.We love the money we save.\n",
      "We enjoy it\n",
      "these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.\n",
      "awesome.understands my kids\n",
      "Fun\n",
      "The Firestick we were sent doesn’t work. At all.  Voice remote won’t even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn’t work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!)\n",
      "love it! so glad we got it on Prime Day, although now having it, I would totally pay full price for it!\n",
      "The greatest\n",
      "Excellent product, set up with ease as well.\n",
      "Not much features.\n",
      "I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.\n",
      "I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.\n",
      "The voice recognition is amazing, perfect companion for the bedroom.\n",
      "Absolutely love it! I use it for everything!I tell my friends and clients that it’s the daughter I never had. I ask her to do something and she doesn’t complain! I wish I bought the 2package deal :( I truly needed one in my work room. I kick myself for it.\n",
      "Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.\n",
      "Not impressed\n",
      "Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American.\n",
      "This is my 3rd Echo and with the built in hub it works great !  Now I have an Echo in the Family Room, My Bedroom and My Home Office.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Love the fire stick and the amazon customer service!!!\n",
      "The speakers on these devices are surprisingly good. The functionality of each echo device is fantastic.\n",
      "I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)\n",
      "Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha\n",
      " \n",
      "Holy sound quality batman! This thing jams. It's insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around.\n",
      "The amazon Alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the Alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen!\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.\n",
      "Sound quality\n",
      "Device is touted as able to link to calendar on my Samsung phone through google, can't get it to work\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great.  I understand the frustration of not having YouTube though.  Still good to have-love seeing the words to songs and if you have the Ring doorbell-you never have to get up from your chair...laziness at it's best!  LOL  All in all- a great product with good speakers.\n",
      "Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.\n",
      "Currently own 3 Chromecast devices and tge Fire Stick is superior to them.  We are so pleased that we can watch programs on Netflix and Prime without a smart phone or computer.  Very easy to install and use!\n",
      "It don’t show nothing\n",
      "Works with Blink video cameras.  Does not work with You Tube.\n",
      "as expected\n",
      "So far, I like it.  It is better than I expecting it.\n",
      "Great, love it!\n",
      "I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.\n",
      "Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!\n",
      "My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions\n",
      " \n",
      "Device has great speakers and the screen quality is phenomenal.\n",
      "I really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.\n",
      "I don’t like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of “inactivity”. I shouldn’t have to “wake up” the fire tv to finish watching a show.\n",
      "I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.\n",
      "Not good at all!\n",
      "Convenient and fun.\n",
      "Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!\n",
      "My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions\n",
      "Needs to be smarter\n",
      "The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.\n",
      "Terrific\n",
      "it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself\n",
      "Sounds great!! Love them!\n",
      "Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.\n",
      "I am impressed with the sound quality.\n",
      "Echo Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.\n",
      "Working great and my daughter loves it!\n",
      "I am very pleased with the Fire Stick.\n",
      "The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\n",
      "I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.\n",
      "I just think that it's to darn confusing. And there are parts that i would try and just wouldn't work. I just don't like it. Not what i thought it would be.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "Music mainly but still checking other features\n",
      "The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.\n",
      "Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker\n",
      "Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!\n",
      "I took advantage of prime Friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  I enjoy the features it comes with. I'm sorry I didn't purchase two of them  Well worth the money.  Its looks great on my nightstand.  Every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  Happy customer!\n",
      "Arrived on time and works amazing!!!\n",
      "I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.\n",
      "Love this for bedside clock/alarm/radio.  Face can dimat night so it’s not bright for sleeping.\n",
      "I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.\n",
      "I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself\n",
      "I love that you can watch Bob Dylan’s movies\n",
      "neat tool we enjoy it with the family\n",
      "Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.\n",
      "Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability\n",
      "Fun to play with\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "It's alright....\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "I love my amazon sticks\n",
      "I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house\n",
      "I absolutely love this thing. And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way. I was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data. Alexa still talked but I couldn't watch movies. SO HAPPY that Amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all.\n",
      "Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "Love it so easy to use\n",
      "A great buy\n",
      "What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!\n",
      "Powerful little stick\n",
      "I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.\n",
      "I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!\n",
      "We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent.\n",
      "Alexa is great only she will laugh or add random comments in conversations. Last night I was asking a sibling why they are using Alexa upstairs versus the one downstairs. Then the echo dot downstairs starting singing “oh technology oh technology” kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own.\n",
      "It is a good addition to my small space, and it keeps me up to date on events and weather conditions.\n",
      "I loved everything about this item. Quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house.\n",
      "I didn’t order it\n",
      "I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.\n",
